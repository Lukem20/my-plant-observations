# Botany Blog
Explore an updated list of my plant observations posted to the iNaturalist platform.

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to practice writing React code and learning the nuances of the library as well as pulling data from an API. Along the way I am also writing more JavaScript to become more versed in the programming language as a whole. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### Details
All observations are deemed research grade by the community. This means that other people have confirmed the identification of that organism and then can be used by scientists and researchers in their work. For now, I am only pulling my observations of plants into this blog. Until I have a clear vision for this blog, I will only post plants for now, although I would consider adding a section for other organism as well.
